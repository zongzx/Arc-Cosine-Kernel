# Arc-Cosine-Kernel
Infinite (of course, we cannot reach infinite) width single layer Relu network approximates Arc Cosine kernel
Experiments.ipynb shows its performance in a binary classification problem ($3$ vs $8$) in MNIST, and arc_cosine_kernel_VS_random_relu.py shows the approximated error of random Relu network with exact Arc Cosine kernel.
